# Assignment 1

### Mats

- Exercise 4.55) I do not understand what is wrong with the implementation of `insertSet`. It should already block duplicates.

### Nikki 

- Is there an easy way to remember the rules applying to the Cartesian product of Theorem 4.38? / How can I visualize it, see the logic behind it?
