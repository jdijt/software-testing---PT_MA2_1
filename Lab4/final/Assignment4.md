# Assignment 4

> Read or reread Chapter 5 of The Haskell Road, and make a list of questions on specific points that cause difficulty of understanding.

### Mats

*No questions*

### Jasper

- The notation used in section 5.6 is confusing to me. Because I am used to read `|a|` as 'the size of a'. Am I correct when I say the collection of equivalence classes R: `A/R = {|a| | a in A}` has the type set of sets? Implying that `|a|` stands for the set of elements that are equivalent to `a` in this case.

### Nikki

- In Lemma 5.81, if a set A would be empty then the proof for part 1 ( every equivalence-class is non-empty, because there is an element a in A, for which a is in the set A [reflexive] ) does not hold because there is no element a in A. Or do I have to see this differently?
