Total time spent by two persons (due to a lost battle with monads) : 12 hours

We first create a list with 100 random inputs for both functions. We then execute both functions with the input and measure the time it takes to execute.

## Conclusion
Even if the `expM` function is executed after the `exM` function the `exM` still is significantly faster.
