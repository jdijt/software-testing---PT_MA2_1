# Report for Assignment 5

The code that we needed for this assignment we did already implement in assignment 1. The functions of matter are:

- `consistent`
- `prune`
- `freeAtPos`

We added a function to `Assignment5` named `showGenNrcSudoku` to show a sudoku problem with the NRC constraints.

The only time we spent on this exercise is the time needed to write this document.
